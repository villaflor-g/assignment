                <h1>❝ Live More, Worry Less ❞ </h1>
                <h2>Don't count the days, Make the days count.</h2>
                <p>It serves as a reminder that life is a journey
                    to be experienced and enjoyed, rather than a 
                    series of problems to be solved. 
                    "Live more, worry less" is not merely a mantra;  
                    it is a lifestyle choice, a commitment to prioritizing 
                    our happiness and well-being above all else.</p>
